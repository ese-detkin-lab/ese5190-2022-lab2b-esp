### TODO:

- use your Lab 1 firefly code to generate ADPS9960 I2C traffic and display it on a lab oscilloscope
- take a screenshot of some portion of this exchange, and figure out/annotate what's happening based on the protocol documentation in the ADPS9960 datasheet 

Connect the APDS9960 and oscilloscope as guide. 

The X(left) probe is connected to SCL(clock) and GND(black wire). 

Set the probe to x10, and switch and set 10:1 in the oscilloscope.

The Y(right) probe is connected to SDA and GND(black wire).

The result shows on oscilloscope as follows:
