### TODO:

Create a REPL to let you read and write RP2040 registers from a console. You should be able to:
- select any 32-bit address to read/write (even if not a valid RP2020 address)
- read/write any 32-bit value to this address
- read/write using any of the atomic bit-setting aliases and a 32-bit mask
