# ESE 519: Lab 2B Expansion Board Proposal
To test and blink the LED, I did the following procedures, as described in the lab handbook.

Finally, connect your RP2040 to the LED in the following manner:

Attached the Stemma QT breakout cable to the RP2040.  
Then, Disconnect the breadboard's power supply.  
Removed the jumper wire from the breadboard power line to the LED.  
Connected the ground pin on the Stemma QT cable to the breadboard's ground pin.  
Connected the GPIO data pin, NOT THE POWER. PIN, to the breadboard's power pin
