Part 7 TODO:
---modify your sequencer to use the PIO as its primary I/O engine, including the ability to R/W any register

The 'pio_sequencer.c' is similar to 'pioscope.c'. Both codes achieve the following functionalities:

1. Utilized PIO as its primary I/O engine.

2. Utilizing the logic analyzer to display any GPIO pin's logic levels through redefining the specific pin setting.

3. Replaying the GPIO pin's behavior through 2 ways: a. through logic analyzer waves, b. through LED blinking(red-1, blue=0)

4. When displaying the logic analyzer waves, * means that no change has been detected in value, the number follows means the 
    clock cycle it keeps unchanged. Only the first "-" or "_" will be displayed. 
    For example, "-----" will be displayed as: "-****4".
