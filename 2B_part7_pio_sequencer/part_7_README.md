Part 7 TODO:
---modify your sequencer to use the PIO as its primary I/O engine, including the ability to R/W any register


1. Utilized PIO as its primary I/O engine.

2. Utilizing the logic analyzer to display any GPIO pin's logic levels through redefining the specific pin setting.

3. C code(pio_sequencer.c) outputs strings in the format of: (timestamp, 1/0). It then communicates with Python which takes in the 
    timestamp
