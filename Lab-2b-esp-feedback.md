# 1.Which parts of the lab specification have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?

Working With resgisters are a bit challanging and generally it was hard to debug and resolve few make and cmake errors.


# 2. Which lab topics have you found most confusing or difficult to understand?
Working with Protocols was considerably hard. Example: Part-5. Besides it, it would be easier to resolve the CMAKE and Make errors by establishing some understanding on it as that is a common error in my case.


# 3. Which parts of the lab have you found most difficult to implement?
Part-5 to Part-10 seemed difficult. More documentations on these would have been helpful as these parts involved a lot of modifications to the code.

# 4. What steps have you taken to resolve these difficulties?
Working with resources such as rhe handbook, assembly guide and the suggested reading lectures (posted on ed discussion) were helpful in understanding the cause of few errors and enabled to resolve them.
