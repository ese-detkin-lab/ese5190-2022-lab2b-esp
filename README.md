2. Proposal 
Outline
We are planning to build a ESPL system that could let us directly W/R data to the registers to the broad rather than calling SDK or upper-level functions. We are going to explore it in the next lab session and show up our builds. 

Components requested: 
Breadbroad, LED, resistor, wires, nothing else.
